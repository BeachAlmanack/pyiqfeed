# pyiqfeed 
Reads data from IQFeed

Contains classes that can read market data from DTN's IQFeed service. You need
a subscription to IQFeed or this won't work. This library is generally kept up
to date to the current version of IQFeed.

Currently it's in pre-alpha. However, once completed the goal is for it to read
every kind of data IQFeed provides and for it to stay up to date with new
IQFeed protocol version.
